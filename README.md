SurfsUp
Module 9 Challenge


Analysis 
The written analysis has the following:

1. Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this week's module is to focus on the analysis of the weather in Hawaii. An analysis was completed for the last 12 months; it is recommended to complete broader analysis with data from 10 years. The database consists of access to daily measurements of temperatures and rain precipitation coming from different stations. We are searching for temperature data for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii for the previous ten years, going back to 2010. This is requested to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable all year.


2. Results:There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)

As shown in the graphs below, in June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0. Standard deviation is 3.26. In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0. Standard deviation is 3.75. These graphs demonstrate that some days in December can reach lower temperatures than those in June.

3. Summary:There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

From this analysis we can determine that December has more appropriate weather conditions for surfing and ice cream. December has some days that reach temperatures lower than 70 degrees, while June has some days above 70 degrees. To be able to make a decision on where to build the shop, more information is required. A query that can be considered would be finding the summary statistics of temperature by station to see if there is any variation of temperature. I would recommend a query analyzing the rainfall as well as winds in Oahu to determine whether specific weather changes affects the demand for surfing and ice cream shops.
